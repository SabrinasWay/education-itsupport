## Research on how the TCP/IP paper was presented by Vinton G. Cerf and Robert E. Kahn. Find the document attached name cerff74.
It is fascinating to me how the concept of the TCP/IP came to be. It is so intelligent that feels out of this world. Before starting my certification studies and diving in to understand how things work behind the hoop I had no previous knowledge of anything. I just knew that things got from point A to point B and that was it. 
But now, oh boy!, now I am obsessed with understanding the nuances, and I must say that "Ignorance is Bliss". 
The anatomy of a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) /IP (Internet Protocol) is something to tear up when you finally understand. It took me a minute to take it all in, and I am not trying to be dramatic here, but instead of just saying cool, cool ... next chapter ... I just had a moment to take it all in and call my mother to share my finding and how crazy all the electrical transmissions and beautifully dancing around with payloads of information.
Nerd, much! Yeah, I am hooked. And to think that I broke my first computer at 15 with a virus thinking that I was hacking into someone's computing using a dial-up (yes, I lived to see those days).
