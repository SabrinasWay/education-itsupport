## Research on how Vinton G. Cerf and Robert E. Kahn presented the TCP/IP paper. Find the paper below.
It is fascinating to me how the concept of the TCP/IP came to be. It is so intelligent that feels out of this world. Before starting my certification studies and diving in to understand how things work behind the hood I had no previous knowledge of anything tech. I just knew that things got from point A to point B and that was it. 
But now, oh boy!, now I am obsessed with understanding the nuances, and I must say that "Ignorance is Bliss". 
The anatomy of a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) /IP (Internet Protocol) is something to tear up when you finally understand. It took me a minute to take it all in, and I am not trying to be dramatic here, but instead of just saying cool, cool ... next chapter ... I just had a moment to take it all in and call my mother to share my finding and how crazy all the electrical transmissions and payloads of information got around. The complexity of it all is pretty amazing.
Nerd, much! Yeah, I got hooked and drank the cool-aid. And to think that I broke my first computer at 15 with a virus thinking that I was hacking into someone's computing using a dial-up (yes, I lived to see those days)....
